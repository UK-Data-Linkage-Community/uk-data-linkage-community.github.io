One of the key targets of the community is to provide a range of publicly accessible materials related to data linkage, driven by community requirements.

Upcoming meetings and workshop events will help to identify common themes and needs from the community, and guide the development of the open resources.

Overarching themes for materials to be produced include:
* For data linkers:
  * Intro to linking data
  * Explaining use cases for Deterministic, Fuzzy, and Probabilistic linkage models
  * How to discuss linkage requirements with vested parties
  * Advice and best practice for building linkage models
* For linked data users: 
  * 
  * Common misconceptions of linked data

If you have suggestions for materials that you would like to see, please submit a request [through github]({{ site.ukdlc_github_discussions }}) or by [email](mailto:{{ site.contact_email }}?subject=UK DLC: Suggestion for materials).
