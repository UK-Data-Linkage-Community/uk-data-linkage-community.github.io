The core objective of this group is to establish an open, cross-sector community dedicated to the general practice of data linkage, namely methodologies, applications, and principles. 
Unlike existing groups, the proposed group will take a broader and more inclusive approach. 
Its openness and generalist focus will facilitate cross-community pollination, enabling members from a variety of sectors to engage in shared learning and collaborative problem-solving.

## <u>UK Data Linkage Community is...</u>
### Open
We welcome members of the field to contribute to the ongoing development of a healthy community.
This includes by engaging in discussions and workshops, or by providing materials and best practice advice.
The community is hosted on [GitHub][ukdlc-github] and welcomes contribution. 

### Collaborative
The community seeks to foster discussion and knowledge sharing amongst linkage practitioners, with the goal of facilitating collaboration across siloed institutions.

### Cross-sector
Data linkage is a critical component of modern data use across many different sectors and applications. 
We welcome members from across public and private sector, including academia, government, and industry. 
We also aim to be agnostic to application domain, supporting linkers in areas such as health, admin, and finance. 

### Productive
We aim to provide materials to support the field of data linkage.
This includes educational resources around data linkage practice, aimed at a variety of target audiences. 
This includes those performing the linkage, using the linked data, and the wider public.
