We are happy to announce an upcoming UK DLC workshop focused on Data Linkers. 

This workshop will bring together data linkage practitioners, those working at the coal-face of data linkage and entity resolution. 
The event will include an opportunity to present and discuss approaches to data linkage, and to identify common methods and best practices.
The workshop will also allow the UK DLC chairs to identify wider needs from the community, guiding the development of resources over the coming months.
