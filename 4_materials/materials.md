One of the key targets of the community is to provide a range of materials related to data linkage.

These resources are driven by community requirements, with key needs identified during the workshop events.

If you have suggestions for materials that you would like to see, please submit a request: link to github issues

## Produced Materials:
* [General materials][general] for those getting started in data linkage. 
* [Linkage Practitioner materials][practitioners] for those undertaking linkages.
* [Linked Data User materials][users] for those using linked data.
